**This is only for Windows Operating System.**

There are three methods to set transparency:

Configuration:
--------------
To set custom transparency levels visit `Preferences > Package Settings > SublimeTextTrans > Settings - User`, it will open the user's custom preferences file for this plugin.

There you can modify the transparency levels, by adding the following and adjusting the levels as you wish:

```json
{

	// If you like to have a different transparency level
	// modify this array of options in your user preferences 
	// i.e. just add (copy/paste) this array and modify at wish
	// IMPORTANT: Level of opacity varies from 0 to 255
	// 0 = Totally transparent, 255 = Fully opaque
	"levels": [
		255, // Full opaque i.e not transparency - a.k.a Disabled
		212, // Level 5
		220, // Level 4
		228, // Level 3
		236, // Level 2
		243  // Level 1
	]
}
```

You can also find other options on `Settings - Default` file.
